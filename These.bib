               characterized by an impaired ventricular filling resulting in
               the development of dyspnea and other HF symptoms. Even though
               echocardiography is the cornerstone to demonstrate structural
               and/or functional alterations of the heart as the underlying
               cause for the clinical presentation, cardiovascular magnetic
               resonance (CMR) represents the noninvasive gold standard to
               assess cardiac morphology, function, and tissue changes. Indeed,
               CMR allows quantification of biventricular volumes, mass, wall
               thickness, systolic function, and intra- and extracardiac flows;
               diastolic functional indices include transmitral and pulmonary
               venous velocities, left ventricular and left atrial filling
               velocities from volumetric changes, strain analysis from
               myocardial tagging, tissue phase contrast, and feature tracking.
               Moreover, CMR allows superior tissue characterization of the
               myocardium and the pericardium, which are crucial for a
               noninvasive etiological and histopathological assessment of
               HFpEF: conventional T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and post-contrast
               sequences are now complemented by quantitative mapping
               sequences, including T1 and T2 mapping as well as extracellular
               volume quantification. Further experimental sequences comprise
               diffusion tensor analysis, blood oxygenation-dependent
               sequences, hyperpolarized contrast agents, spectroscopy, and
               elastography. Finally, artificial intelligence is beginning to
               help clinicians deal with an increasing amount of information
               from CMR exams.",

However, excess epicardial adipose tissue has been shown to be associated with prevalence and severity of atrial fibrillation. In arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy and myotonic dystrophy, fibrofatty infiltration of the myocardium is associated with ventricular arrhythmias. In the ovine model of ischemic cardiomyopathy, the presence of intramyocardial adipose or lipomatous metaplasia has been associated with increased propensity to ventricular tachycardia. These observations suggest a role of adipose tissue in the pathogenesis of cardiac arrhythmias. In this article, we review the role of cardiac adipose tissue in various cardiac arrhythmias and discuss the possible pathophysiologic mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent cardiac arrhythmia in clinical practice. AF is often associated with profound functional and structural alterations of the atrial myocardium that compose its substrate. Recently, a relationship between the thickness of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) and the incidence and severity of AF has been reported. Adipose tissue is a biologically active organ regulating the metabolism of neighbouring organs. It is also a major source of cytokines. In the heart, EAT is contiguous with the myocardium without fascia boundaries resulting in paracrine effects through the release of adipokines. Indeed, Activin A, which is produced in abundance by EAT during heart failure or diabetes, shows a marked fibrotic effect on the atrial myocardium. The infiltration of adipocytes into the atrial myocardium could also disorganize the depolarization wave front favouring micro re-entry circuits and local conduction block. Finally, EAT contains progenitor cells in abundance and therefore could be a source of myofibroblasts producing extracellular matrix. The study on the role played by adipose tissue in the pathogenesis of AF is just starting and is highly likely to uncover new biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AF.},

abstract = {The heart possesses a regeneration potential derived from endogenous and exogenous stem and progenitor cell populations, though baseline regeneration appears to be sub-therapeutic. This limitation was initially attributed to a lack of cells with cardiomyogenic potential following an insult to the myocardium. Rather, recent studies demonstrate increased numbers of cardiomyocyte progenitor cells in diseased hearts. Given that the limiting factor does not appear to be cell quantity but rather repletion of functional cardiomyocytes, it is crucial to understand potential mechanisms inhibiting progenitor cell differentiation. One of the extensively studied areas in heart disease is extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, with both the composition and mechanical properties of the ECM undergoing changes in diseased hearts. This review explores the influence of ECM properties on cardiomyogenesis and adult cardiac progenitor cells.}
